Superstore Executive Sales Performance Dashboard

1. Project Goal
To create an interactive dashboard that provides executive and managerial stakeholders with a high-level, real-time view of the Superstore's key sales, profit, and customer metrics to enable rapid performance assessment and targeted decision-making.

2. Target Audience
Executives (CEO, COO): For quick assessment of overall business health, profit margins, and customer base size.

Sales Managers: For monitoring state-level performance, identifying top customers, and managing sales volume.

Product/Marketing Managers: For analyzing which product categories and sub-categories are driving sales and profit.

Business Use Case: Driving Sales Strategy and Optimization

1. Use Case: High-Level Performance Review
Business Question: How is the overall business performing this quarter/year compared to the previous period?    

Executive Action: The CEO/Executive looks at the KPIs (Sales, Profit, Total Customers) for the relevant time period. If Profit is significantly down, they immediately investigate the map to see if the drop is concentrated in a particular high-value state (e.g., New York, California) or if it's a systemic issue.

2. Use Case: Geographic Sales Optimization
Business Question: Which geographic areas are underperforming or have the highest profit potential?

Managerial Action: The Sales Manager focuses on the Sales Volume Across States Map.

Action 1 (Problem Identification): They notice a state is a light color (low sales). They click the State/Province filter to isolate that state's data. The KPIs update, showing the exact sales/profit figure, and the Top Customers list updates to show the major customers in that state.

Action 2 (Opportunity Identification): They see a state with high sales but a low-profit margin. This signals a need to investigate product pricing or logistics costs in that region.

3. Use Case: Targeted Customer Marketing/Retention
Business Question: Who are our most valuable customers, and what are they buying?

Marketing Action: The Marketing Team looks at the Top Sales by Customer list.

Action 1 (Retention): They identify the top 3-5 customers (e.g., Seth Vernon, Raymond Bush). They use this list to initiate dedicated account management, loyalty programs, or personalized communication to ensure retention.

Action 2 (Cross-Selling): They select "Seth Vernon" on the bar chart (if available) or use the Customer Name filter. The dashboard KPIs and filters update to show what Vernon purchased and when, helping them recommend related products or forecast future needs.

4. Use Case: Product Portfolio Analysis
Business Question: Which products are driving the most value in our core markets?

Product Manager Action: The Product Manager selects a high-performing state (e.g., New York) on the map. They then use the Product Category and Sub-Category filters to drill down.

Observation: Sales for "Office Supplies" are high, but profit is low.

Action: The manager investigates specific sub-categories within Office Supplies to pinpoint items that need a price increase or a process improvement to boost profit margin.
